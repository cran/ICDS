Description: Identify Cancer Dysfunctional Sub-pathway by integrating gene expression, DNA methylation and copy number variation, and pathway topological information. 1)We firstly calculate the gene risk scores by integrating three kinds of data: DNA methylation, copy number variation, and gene expression.  2)Secondly, we perform a greedy search algorithm to identify the key dysfunctional sub-pathways within the pathways for which the discriminative scores were locally maximal. 3)Finally, the permutation test was used to calculate statistical significance level for these key dysfunctional sub-pathways.
